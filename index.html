  <p>
    Tags have angle brackets, <strong style="font-size: 16pt;"><</strong> and <strong style="font-size: 16pt;">></strong>, which &lt;wrap&gt; around text to make elements.
    <br>
    The frontslash character leans forward: /
    <br>
    Elements can have attributes:
    <br>
      <span style="color: rebeccapurple;">This span has a style attribute. </span>
    <br>
    p tags are for paragraphs. <strong>strong</strong> & <em>em</em> tags make text <strong>bold</strong> & <em>italic</em>, respectively. Similarly, you can use the sup and sub tags to make text <sup>superscript</sup> or <sub>subscript</sub>.
    <br>
    Another cool thing you can do is use q tags for short <q>quotes</q>.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    You should always use blockquote tags for longer quotations, a --<br>-- br tag for a line break, and an hr tag for a horizontal rule.
    <br>
    These tags are self-closing, as there is no matching closing tag.

  <p>
    <abbr title="For Your Information">FYI (hover me!)</abbr>, the abbr tag is for abbreviations.
    <br>
    The cite tag is for <cite>Titles of Works</cite> by some author.
    <br>
    You can also show text that has been <del>deleted</del> or <ins>inserted</ins>; or you can just use the s tag to make a <s>strikethrough</s>.
